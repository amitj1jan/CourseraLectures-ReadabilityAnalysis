## CourseraLectures-ReadabilityAnalysis
The CourseraLectures-ReadabilityAnalysis project focuses on analyzing the readability of Coursera course video transcripts using the textstat.flesch_reading_ease library. It calculates the Flesch Reading Ease (FRES) score for each video transcript and generates a chart to visualize the readability trends across different course videos.

### Overview
The CourseraLectures-ReadabilityAnalysis project aims to provide insights into the readability of Coursera course materials by utilizing the Flesch Reading Ease (FRES) metric. By analyzing the transcripts of course videos, this project allows you to assess the complexity of the language used and identify any readability patterns or trends throughout the course.

### Key Features
- **Transcript processing:** 
The project extracts the text transcripts from Coursera course videos and performs necessary pre-processing to prepare the data for readability analysis.
- **Flesch Reading Ease (FRES) score calculation:** 
Utilizing the textstat.flesch_reading_ease library, the project computes the Flesch Reading Ease score for each video transcript. This score provides an indication of the text's readability, with higher scores suggesting easier-to-understand content.
- **Chart visualization:** 
The project generates a chart that showcases the Flesch Reading Ease scores across different course videos, enabling you to compare the readability levels and identify any notable patterns or variations.

### Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:
- **Transcript extraction:** 
This module focuses on extracting the text transcripts from Coursera course videos. It may include techniques to handle various video formats and extract the relevant textual content.
- **Pre-processing:** 
In this module, the extracted transcripts undergo pre-processing steps such as removing special characters, normalizing text, and handling stopwords to ensure accurate readability analysis.
- **Flesch Reading Ease (FRES) calculation:** 
The FRES score is calculated using the textstat.flesch_reading_ease library, which considers factors such as sentence length and average syllables per word to assess the readability of the text.
- **Chart generation:** 
The project generates a visual chart, such as a line graph or a bar chart, to represent the Flesch Reading Ease scores across different course videos, allowing for easy comparison and identification of readability trends.
